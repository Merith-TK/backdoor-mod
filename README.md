# Commands Backdoor

The Name of this mod is purely because it *technically is* a backdoor,

***DO NOT USE ON A SERVER HOST, WILL MOST LIKELY GET YOUR ACCOUNT AND SERVER DELETED***

This mod allows the user to run commands from ingame, through two commands

1. `/cmd`
	* this one will be removed and is purely for testing things
	* on windows, this just opens a command prompt from within the `.minecraft` folder
2. `/exec <command>`
	* this takes whatever you put for `command` and runs it as an actual command on the server host
	* hence why I say to *never run this on a server host that you do not physically own*
